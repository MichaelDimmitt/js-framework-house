## Run the script in package.json with an appname; your app will be created or served.

## Usage example derived from the package.json
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/quick-angular-non-global-install.git;
npm install;
npm run angular angular-project-name;
npm run vue vue-project-name;
npm run cra react-project-name;
npm run ember ember-project-name;
```

## Already created the app? No problem, the project will start the server!

## Future case
1) Coming soon! preact implementation.
1) Scripts will create projects into a folder matching that framework.
<br/> example: `npm run vue appname` will create a project at `./vue/appname`
